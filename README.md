IMASE Is a project that I started just for fun born in January 2021. IMASE is an acronym that stays for "I Moderate And Something Else".

## What does this bot do?
 As the name says this bot has moderating commands (lock, unlock, kick, ban, clear10...) and other stuff like commands that use Reddit (meme, cat, aww, dog), commands to help you to choose (randomnumber), commands to just tell you some curious facts (fact) and to give you some infos bout your server (serverinfo)...
